Q: What is the simplest way to get started with Python programming?
A: Start with a "Hello World" program - a basic script that prints a message to the console.
   This demonstrates the fundamental concept of program execution and output.

Q: Why is this script useful for beginners?
A: It introduces the print() function, which is one of the most commonly used functions
   in Python for displaying output. It's the foundation for understanding how programs
   communicate with users.

Q: What does this specific example demonstrate?
A: This script prints "Hello, LangChain!" to demonstrate a simple Python program that
   can be run from the command line, showing the basic structure of a Python script.

SAMPLE CODE:
"""

# The print() function outputs text to the console/terminal
# This is the simplest form of program output in Python
print("Hello, LangChain!")
